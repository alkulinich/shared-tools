# Upgrade Guide

## To v1.2.5 — from v1.2.4

Patch release. **Real bug fix** — recommended for anyone with long-running
sessions.

### Fixed

- **Stop hook no longer crashes with SIGPIPE on transcripts > 64 KB.**
  v1.2.2 introduced byte-window slicing using `tail -c +X | head -c Y`
  pipelines inside `read_window`. When the transcript is larger than the
  OS pipe buffer (~64 KB on macOS/Linux), `head` closes the pipe after
  reading `Y` bytes while `tail` still has more to write — `tail` exits
  141 (SIGPIPE), and under `set -euo pipefail` that 141 propagated and
  aborted the whole script. Symptom: Claude Code reported `Stop hook
  error: Failed with non-blocking status code: No stderr output` on
  long sessions; offset state still advanced (the failure is downstream
  of that), so subsequent fires would re-fail on the next chunk window
  rather than re-screening already-processed bytes.

  Fix: append `|| true` to each `tail | head` pipeline in `read_window`
  and in the slice-extract path. The output is already complete by the
  time `tail` dies, so suppressing the pipefail propagation is safe.

### Test added

- `test_no_sigpipe_on_large_transcript` — builds a 100 KB transcript,
  forces 8 KB chunks, and asserts script exits 0. The previous chunking
  test used a 635-byte transcript that fits entirely in the pipe buffer
  (so `tail` finished before SIGPIPE could fire), which is why the bug
  was missed earlier.

## To v1.2.4 — from v1.2.3

Patch release. No user action required.

### Fixed

- **Subagent output is now JSON-validated before replacing the regex-only
  fallback.** Previously the hook trusted `claude -p`'s exit status, but a
  0 exit with truncated stdout is a real failure mode (observed on >5 MB
  transcripts pre-v1.2.2). The script now runs `jq -e .` on the temp file
  after `claude -p` returns; if the output isn't parseable JSON, the temp
  is discarded and the synchronous regex-only fallback already on disk
  remains the artifact. Triage now has a guarantee: every `raw/*.json`
  file is parseable JSON.

## To v1.2.3 — from v1.2.2

Patch release. No user action required. Documentation/clarity fix only;
behavior unchanged from v1.2.2.

### Fixed

- **Subagent prompt now reflects the slice-file reality.**
  `scripts/punts-extract-prompt.sh` was still calling its input
  `transcript_path` and telling the subagent to "Read the transcript at
  …" — but since v1.2.2 the file passed in is actually a per-chunk slice
  with intentionally-clipped surrounding bytes. The prompt now names it a
  "transcript slice" and instructs the subagent to limit quotes to what's
  in the slice; the variable is renamed `slice_path` for the same reason.
  The `session_ended_at` line also notes that the timestamp reflects when
  the Stop hook fired, not when the underlying messages were originally
  written (matters during backlog drains). No functional change to the
  hook or the output schema.

## To v1.2.2 — from v1.2.1

Patch release. No user action required.

### Fixed

- **Punt subagent no longer chokes on long sessions.** v1.2.1 made the outer
  Stop hook incremental, but the subagent's own prompt still said *"Read the
  transcript at `<full transcript>`"* — so on long-running dialogs (e.g. a
  multi-week session that had accumulated 5+ MB of JSONL with hundreds of
  matched phrases) `claude -p` blew its input context and either errored or
  wrote a truncated/malformed raw file. The hook now hands the subagent a
  per-chunk slice file (just the new byte window, plus a small lookback for
  the "1-2 surrounding lines" context quote) and slices large windows into
  multiple chunks, fanning out one detached `claude -p` per chunk.

### Behavior changes

- Output filenames are now `raw/<session_id>-<chunk_end>-<pid>.json` — one
  per chunk that contains hits. Steady-state sessions still produce one file
  per Stop fire (one chunk = one file); only oversized windows fan out.
- Slice files live at `.claude/punts/state/slice-<session_id>-<chunk_end>-<pid>.jsonl`
  and are deleted by the backgrounded subshell after enrichment. Already
  covered by the same `.claude/punts/state/` gitignore note from v1.2.1.

### New tunables (env vars)

- `PUNT_MAX_CHUNK` — max bytes per chunk handed to one subagent
  (default `262144`, i.e. 256 KB).
- `PUNT_LOOKBACK` — bytes of pre-chunk context included in each slice
  (default `4096`, i.e. 4 KB).

Both are read once per Stop fire; no need to set them globally unless you
want different behavior than the defaults.

## To v1.2.1 — from v1.2.0

Patch release. No user action required.

### Fixed

- **Stop hook no longer re-screens the entire transcript on every turn.**
  `scripts/punts-detect.sh` previously `jq`-walked the full JSONL transcript
  from byte 0 at every Stop fire, even though transcripts are append-only —
  making the hook's cost grow linearly with session length. The script now
  persists a per-session byte offset at `.claude/punts/state/<session_id>.offset`
  and only screens bytes added since the last run. Output filenames change from
  `raw/<session_id>.json` (overwritten each run) to
  `raw/<session_id>-<offset>-<pid>.json` (one per Stop run that finds hits) —
  `/rulez:punts-triage` already iterates `raw/*.json` so it consumes the new
  shape transparently.

### Project-level housekeeping

If your project tracks `.claude/punts/raw/` in `.gitignore`, add
`.claude/punts/state/` to the same ignore block — state files are transient
bookkeeping, not artifacts.

## To v1.2.0 — from v1.1.4

Additive feature release. No breaking changes. Re-run `bin/setup` (or let the
SessionStart auto-update do it) to pick up the new Stop hook.

### What's new

- **Punt detection.** Sessions now end with a regex screen of the transcript
  for "pre-existing", "out of scope", and similar phrasing — plus the
  explicit `[PUNT]: <reason>` marker (now documented in `RULEZ.md`). When at
  least one hit is found, a backgrounded `claude -p` extracts structured
  evidence into `.claude/punts/raw/<session-uuid>.json`. The hook returns
  immediately so the UI is not blocked. If `claude` is not on PATH, the raw
  regex hits are written instead so evidence is never lost.
- **Triage on demand.** New `/rulez:punts-triage` slash command walks the
  accumulated raw evidence interactively. APPROVE writes a curated
  `.claude/punts/<slug>.md` (git-tracked, one issue per file); REJECT drops
  the row; SKIP leaves it for next time; MERGE appends to an existing `.md`
  when the same `id` (SHA-1 of the claim) resurfaces.
- **`RULEZ.md` addition.** New `## Punts` section asking Claude to flag
  out-of-scope decisions as `[PUNT]: <reason>` on their own line. Soft hint —
  the regex catches both marked and un-marked punts.

### Project-level housekeeping

The runtime data lives under `<project>/.claude/punts/`:

- `.claude/punts/raw/` — transient evidence; safe to delete.
- `.claude/punts/<slug>.md` — curated knowledge.

Most projects already gitignore `.claude/` wholesale; if you want to track
the curated `.md` files in git, narrow the ignore to:

```
.claude/*
!.claude/punts/
.claude/punts/raw/
```

### Disabling

If you do not want the Stop hook, edit `~/.claude/settings.json` and remove
the `Stop` entry whose command references `rulez-claudeset/scripts/punts-detect.sh`.
`bin/setup` will not re-add it on subsequent runs as long as a hook with that
command path exists, so removing it is sticky.

---

## To v1.1.4 — from v1.1.3

Patch release. No user action required.

### Fixed

- **Statusline context meter now reflects auto-compact proximity, not full-window proximity.** Previously the bar percentage came straight from upstream's `.context_window.used_percentage`, which is calculated against the full model context (1M on Opus 4.7) — so a session at 149k / 400k tokens (the threshold `/context` reports as "37%") was rendered as 15%, staying green long after auto-compact was imminent. The meter now sums the raw input tokens from `.context_window.current_usage` and divides against the auto-compact threshold (400k on 1M-context models, full window otherwise). The number now matches what `/context` shows. See [claude-code#43989](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/43989).

  Pre-first-API-call (when `current_usage` is null), falls back to `used_percentage × 2.5` on 1M models, then to the raw `used_percentage` for non-1M models.

---

## To v1.1.3 — from v1.1.2

Patch release. No user action required.

### Fixed

- **`/effort` chip in the statusline now actually renders.** It never worked: the primary probe read a `.effort_level` / `.model.effort` JSON field that upstream doesn't emit (tracked at [anthropics/claude-code#51982](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/51982)), and the fallback chain (`CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL` env var, `effortLevel` in settings.json) was unset for most users — so the chip resolved to empty every render.

  The bogus JSON probe is gone. In its place, the script now scans `transcript_path` for the most recent explicit `/effort <level>` invocation, which captures mid-session overrides as long as you pass the level as an arg (e.g., `/effort max`). The interactive picker form (`/effort` + arrow-key selection) still can't be captured — Claude Code doesn't write the selected value anywhere the statusline can read, so picker-selected overrides remain invisible until upstream exposes effort in the statusline JSON.

- **Chip label set matches real CLI values.** Added `xhigh` → `XHI`; removed non-existent `auto`. Unknown values fall back to an uppercase 4-char truncation.

### To see the chip

The chip is still opt-in — nothing displays until effort is resolvable from one of these sources (in order):

1. Most recent `/effort <level>` in the current session's transcript.
2. `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL` env var, e.g. `export CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL=high`.
3. `effortLevel` in the project `.claude/settings.json`.
4. `effortLevel` in `~/.claude/settings.json`.

## To v1.1.2 — from v1.1.1

Patch release. No user action required.

### Fixed

- **Completes the shallow-clone fix from v1.1.1.** v1.1.1 dropped `--depth 1` from new fetches, but a pre-existing shallow clone (from a v1.0.0 install) isn't automatically unshallowed by a plain `git fetch origin main` — it just fetches the new tip and leaves the ancestry gap, so `pull --ff-only` still reports false divergence. Both `bin/auto-update.sh` and `/rulez:update-claudeset` now detect `.git/shallow` and call `git fetch --unshallow origin main` on the first run, converting the clone to full history once. Subsequent runs use a plain fetch.

Users upgrading from v1.1.0 or earlier: the first auto-update after pulling v1.1.2 will do a one-time full-history fetch of this repo (small — a few hundred KB). After that, fetches are incremental as usual.

---

## To v1.1.1 — from v1.1.0

Patch release. Superseded by v1.1.2 (the fix was incomplete — see v1.1.2 notes above).

---

## To v1.1.0 — from v1.0.0

Additive release. No breaking changes, no migration required beyond letting the SessionStart auto-update pull in the new code (or running `/rulez:update-claudeset`). `bin/setup` is idempotent and will pick up the new symlinks/settings additively.

### What's new

| Feature | Summary |
|---------|---------|
| `/rulez:todo` command | Manage a project-root `TODO.txt` in the [todo.txt format](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt/). Agent-interpretive — type `/rulez:todo buy milk`, `/rulez:todo done 3`, `/rulez:todo archive`, etc. Backed by `scripts/todo.sh` with full todo.sh subcommand parity (`add`, `ls`, `do`, `rm`, `pri`, `archive`). |
| HANDOFF.md history in git | `/rulez:handoff` now commits `HANDOFF.md` after rewriting it. Past handoffs are preserved as git history on the current branch — view with `git log -p HANDOFF.md`. No separate HISTORY.md or CHANGELOG.md. Backed by `scripts/git-commit-handoff.sh`. |
| `/effort` level in statusline | Statusline now shows a magenta `LOW` / `MED` / `HI` / `MAX` / `AUTO` chip between the model and session time. Sourced from (in order): undocumented JSON path, `$CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL`, project `.claude/settings.json`, user `~/.claude/settings.json`. Omitted silently when nothing is configured. *Known gap:* mid-session `/effort max` doesn't persist to disk, so the chip won't reflect it until you also update settings. |
| `RULEZ.md` global rules | New `RULEZ.md` at the repo root is symlinked to `~/.claude/RULEZ.md` by `bin/setup`, and `@RULEZ.md` is appended to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` so its contents are always in context. Current content: compact-instructions for preserving architecture/decisions/verification state during session compression. |

### Minor rename

`install.sh` → `bin/setup-per-project.sh`. If you had documentation or muscle memory pointing at `./install.sh`, update it. The global setup entry point (`bin/setup`) is unchanged.

### Stuck clone? (fixed in v1.1.1, kept here for reference)

`bin/auto-update.sh` uses `git pull --ff-only`, which refuses to reconcile when the local clone at `~/.claude/skills/rulez-claudeset/` has committed locally (e.g., manual edits in the clone). If your clone has truly diverged (has unique local commits), run:

```bash
# 1. Check if there's anything unique in your local commits first
git -C ~/.claude/skills/rulez-claudeset log --oneline origin/main..HEAD

# 2. If the above is empty or duplicates of work already on origin, reset:
git -C ~/.claude/skills/rulez-claudeset fetch origin main
git -C ~/.claude/skills/rulez-claudeset reset --hard origin/main
~/.claude/skills/rulez-claudeset/bin/setup
```

## To v1.0.0 — from shared-tools (GitHub Flow, no develop branch)

If you used the `shared-tools/claude-example/` submodule with GitHub Flow (`main`-only) and unprefixed commands like `/start-issue`.

### What changed

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `shared-tools/` git submodule per repo | Global install at `~/.claude/skills/rulez-claudeset/` |
| `shared-tools/claude-example/scripts/install.sh` | `./bin/setup` (one-time) |
| `/start-issue`, `/create-pr`, etc. | `/rulez:start-issue`, `/rulez:create-pr`, etc. |
| `./shared-tools/claude-example/scripts/*.sh` | `~/.claude/skills/rulez-claudeset/scripts/*.sh` |
| Manual `git submodule update` | Auto-updates on session start |

### Migration steps

1. **Install globally:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:alkulinich/rulez-claudeset.git ~/.claude/skills/rulez-claudeset
   cd ~/.claude/skills/rulez-claudeset && ./bin/setup
   ```

2. **Remove old submodule** from each project repo:
   ```bash
   git submodule deinit -f shared-tools
   git rm -f shared-tools
   rm -rf .git/modules/shared-tools
   git commit -m "chore: remove shared-tools submodule (migrated to global install)"
   ```

3. **Remove old commands** that were copied by `install.sh`:
   ```bash
   rm -f .claude/commands/start-issue.md
   rm -f .claude/commands/create-pr.md
   rm -f .claude/commands/test-pr.md
   rm -f .claude/commands/push-fixes.md
   rm -f .claude/commands/merge-pr.md
   rm -f .claude/commands/add-issue.md
   rm -f .claude/commands/brainstorm.md
   rm -f .claude/commands/simple-script.md
   rm -f .claude/commands/dispatch-subagent.md
   rm -f .claude/commands/handoff.md
   rm -rf .claude/commands/new-project/
   ```

4. **Clean up old permission paths** in your repo's `.claude/settings.json`:
   Remove all entries matching these patterns:
   ```
   Bash(./shared-tools/claude-example/scripts/...)
   Bash(shared-tools/claude-example/scripts/...)
   Bash(bash shared-tools/claude-example/scripts/...)
   Skill(start-issue)
   Skill(create-pr)
   Skill(test-pr)
   Skill(push-fixes)
   ```
   The global `~/.claude/settings.json` now has the correct paths and `Skill(rulez:*)` entries.

5. **Update statusLine** in your repo's `.claude/settings.json`:
   Remove the old statusLine that references `shared-tools/claude-example/scripts/session-time.sh` — the global settings now handle this.

6. **Update git-workflow.md** if your repo has one:
   Replace `/start-issue` → `/rulez:start-issue` (and other commands).

7. **Update CLAUDE.md** references if any point to `shared-tools/claude-example/scripts/` or old command names.

---

## To v1.0.0 — from legacy (shared submodule with develop branch)

If you previously used the `shared/` submodule approach with `setup-commands.sh` / `sync-config.sh`, follow these steps.

### What changed

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `shared/` or `shared-tools/` git submodule per repo | Global install at `~/.claude/skills/rulez-claudeset/` |
| `shared/scripts/setup-commands.sh` | `./bin/setup` (one-time) |
| `shared/scripts/sync-config.sh` | Automatic via SessionStart hook |
| `develop` → `main` branching (GitFlow) | `main`-only (GitHub Flow) |
| `/start-issue`, `/create-pr`, etc. | `/rulez:start-issue`, `/rulez:create-pr`, etc. |
| `./shared/scripts/git-start-issue.sh` | `~/.claude/skills/rulez-claudeset/scripts/git-start-issue.sh` |
| Manual `cd shared && git pull` | Auto-updates on session start |

### Migration steps

1. **Install globally:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alkulinich/rulez-claudeset ~/.claude/skills/rulez-claudeset
   cd ~/.claude/skills/rulez-claudeset && ./bin/setup
   ```

2. **Remove old submodule** from each project repo:
   ```bash
   git submodule deinit -f shared
   git rm -f shared
   rm -rf .git/modules/shared
   git commit -m "chore: remove legacy shared submodule"
   ```
   (Replace `shared` with `shared-tools` or `shared-tools/claude-example` if that was your submodule path.)

3. **Remove old commands** that were copied by `setup-commands.sh`:
   ```bash
   rm -f .claude/commands/start-issue.md
   rm -f .claude/commands/create-pr.md
   rm -f .claude/commands/test-pr.md
   rm -f .claude/commands/push-fixes.md
   rm -f .claude/commands/merge-pr.md
   rm -f .claude/commands/add-issue.md
   rm -rf .claude/commands/new-project/
   ```
   The new commands live at `~/.claude/commands/rulez/` (symlinked) and use the `/rulez:` prefix.

4. **Clean up old permission paths** in your repo's `.claude/settings.json`:
   Remove entries like:
   ```
   Bash(./shared-tools/claude-example/scripts/...)
   Bash(shared/scripts/...)
   ```
   The global `~/.claude/settings.json` now has the correct paths. Per-project settings only need project-specific permissions.

5. **Update git-workflow.md** if your repo has one:
   - Replace `/start-issue` → `/rulez:start-issue` (and other commands)
   - If you were using `develop` as integration branch, decide whether to switch to GitHub Flow (`main`-only)

6. **Update CLAUDE.md** references if any point to `shared/scripts/` or old command names.

### Branch strategy change (optional)

The legacy setup used GitFlow (`main` + `develop` + `feature/*`). The new default is GitHub Flow (`main` + `feature/*`). If you want to keep `develop`, the commands still work — they default to `main` as base branch, but you can pass a custom base to `/rulez:create-pr`.
